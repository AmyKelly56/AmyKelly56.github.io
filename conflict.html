                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">Interpersonal conflict is an inevitable and a normal part of our personal and professional lives. However, many people avoid it altogether or otherwise handle it in ways that are counterproductive for themselves and others. Understanding conflict and why it occurs, starts with self awareness. How we react/respond to conflict is behavioural. It is only when we are aware of what triggers our reaction (fight/flight/freeze) can we change it to a controlled response. Mary Ellen employs a variety of methodologies to work with individuals to help improve their self-awareness, emotional intelligence and conflict confidence.

                    <h3>Conflict Dynamics Profile</h3>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;"> The Conflict Dynamics Profile –Individual tool (CDP-I) developed by the Center for Conflict Dynamics Eckerd College, Florida is a self-reporting workplace behavioural diagnostic tool, which examines how a person responds to conflict. It measures ‘hot buttons’ i.e. the behaviours of others that trigger us into conflict, and when we are triggered, the frequency with which we respond both constructively and destructively. The ultimate aim of the CDP-I is to facilitate a Development Plan with the user that will enhance their conflict competence and result in positive outcomes to conflict for them in their workplace.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">The assessment is completed online. It takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. A comprehensive feedback report is then provided together with a detailed Development Guide. This report provides the individual with information on the items that have been measured and practical suggestions about how they can change or alter their behaviour to deal with conflict more effectively. The result is increased conflict competence and skills practice to manage workplace behaviours.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">The CDP must be administered by a trained consultant/coach. The Coach works with the individuals in a confidential coaching session to develop new practical solutions and strategies to help resolve a given conflict or the development of a new approach to dealing with conflict more effectively.

                    <h3>Conflict Coaching</h3>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">Conflict Coaching is provided to individuals in a confidential one-to-one session. Mary Ellen aligns this training with the CINERGY conflict coaching model. The objective of this session is to provide the client with an opportunity to discuss the conflict in which they find themselves, to look at it afresh and in a way that helps them to understand in greater depth the dynamics of what is going on for them and the person(s) with whom they are in conflict. Mary Ellen works with her clients to help develop their self-awareness and conflict competence, in turn helping them to develop new constructive options and solutions for dealing with their situation.
